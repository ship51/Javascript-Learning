# About this project:
**1. Data Selfie App**
  Web based application which takes the location, details (name, age) and picture of the user and stores in a database using the Javascript p5js (https://p5js.org/) library.
  The data is also retreivable at the user end who can view all the entries stored in the database.
  
  PS: The server is enabled using node.js and is a prerequisite for running.
  


# How to get started:

(Make sure you are logged in to Git ('https://git-scm.com/download') using your Github username and email using Git bash or CMD)

**1.** Go to Command Prompt and clone the Repository using (not in double quotes) <br/>
```git clone <"link of the repo copied from the website">```

The repository is saved in the same directory as the present working directory in command prompt.


**2.** Install node.js for a virtual server from 
https://nodejs.org/en/


**3.** Open up VS Code (or install if you haven't yet):
https://code.visualstudio.com/ 
Has been fun to work with it, and I am really loving it; wish I had realised earlier.


**4.** Open VS Code: You can even do step 1 now. Open the cloned repository or switch your directory using CMD.


**5.** Type "node index.js" in Command Prompt to get the server up and running. 
A message "Listening at 3000" means that the server is set up successfully.


**6.** Go to any browser, and type ``localhost:3000`` in the address bar. 
This loads index.html in the public folder


**7.** Edit your code in VS Code: add/ edit stuff


**8.** Follow the steps to commit ✔️ : <br/>
a. Stage your changes .

```git add .```

b. Commit your changes  (name your commit in double quotes).

```git commit -m "Name of the commit"```

c. Push the committed changes into relevant branch

```git push origin <branch_name>```
