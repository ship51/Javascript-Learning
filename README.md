How to get started:

1. Go to Command Prompt and clone the Repository using: git clone <"link of the repo copied from the website">
    The repository is saved in the same directory as the present working directory in command prompt.

2. Install node.js for a virtual server from https://nodejs.org/en/ 

3. Open up VS Code (or install if you haven't yet): https://code.visualstudio.com/ 
    Has been fun to work with it, and I am really loving it; wish I had realised earlier.

4. Can even do step 1 in VS Code. Open the clone repository or switch your directory using CMD

5. Type "node index.js" in Command Prompt to get the server up and running.
    A message "Listening at 3000" means that the server is set up successfully.

6. Go to any browser, and type "localhost:3000" in the address bar.
    This loads index.html in the public folder

7. Edit your code in VS Code/ add stuff

8. Follow the steps to commit:  a.  git add .
                                b.  git commit -m "Name of the commit"
                                c.  git push origin main
                        
9. Done.
