How to get started:

(Make sure you are logged in to Git ('https://git-scm.com/download') using your Github username and email using Git bash or CMD)


**1.** Go to Command Prompt and clone the Repository using: 
    ```
    git clone <"link of the repo copied from the website">
    ```
The repository is saved in the same directory as the present working directory in command prompt.

<br/>

**2.** Install node.js for a virtual server from <br/>
    https://nodejs.org/en/

<br/>

**3.** Open up VS Code (or install if you haven't yet): 
    https://code.visualstudio.com/  <br/>
    Has been fun to work with it, and I am really loving it; wish I had realised earlier.

<br/>

**4.** Open VS Code: You can even do step 1 now. Open the cloned repository or switch your directory using CMD.


**5.** Type "node index.js" in Command Prompt to get the server up and running. <br/>
    A message "Listening at 3000" means that the server is set up successfully.

<br/>

**6.** Go to any browser, and type "localhost:3000" in the address bar. <br/>
    This loads index.html in the public folder

<br/>

**7.** Edit your code in VS Code/ add stuff

<br/>

**8.** Follow the steps to commit: <br/>
   a. Track your changes:heavy_check_mark: . 
    ```
    git add .
    ```

   b. Commit your changes .
    ```
    git commit -m "Name of the commit"
    ``` 
    
   c. Push the committed changes into relevant branch
    ```
    git push origin <branch_name>
    ``` 



DONE :).
